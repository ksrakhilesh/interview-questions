## Expense Sharing System

You are tasked with designing an expense sharing system that allows users to track shared expenses among a group of people. The system should support the following functionalities:

#### (Q1) Add Expense

Implement a function that allows a user to add an expense. The function should take the following parameters:

- Main user (the one who paid)
- Amount of the expense
- List of users included in the payment
- Shares of each user (which can be equal, exact amounts, or percentages)
- Metadata about the expense


#### (Q2) Generate Individual Summary

Implement a function that generates a summary for each individual user. This summary should show all the expenses they are involved in and whether they owe money or are owed money.

Example 1: 
```python
expense_system.add_expense("A", 1000, ["B", "C", "D"], "equal")
```
Expected User A Summary:
```
B owes A 250
C owes A 250
D owes A 250
```

Expected User B Summary:
```
B owes A 250
```


Example 2:
```python
expense_system.add_expense("B", 1000, ["A", "C"], "exact", {"A": 300, "C": 500})
```
Expected User B Summary:

```python
user_a_summary = expense_system.generate_individual_summary("B")
A owes B 50 (300 - 250)
C owes B 500
```
Expected User C Summary:

```python
user_a_summary = expense_system.generate_individual_summary("B")
C owes A 250
C owes B 500
```

Example 3:
```python
expense_system.add_expense("C", 1000, ["A", "B", "D"], "percentage", {"A": 25, "B": 30, "D": 10})
```
Expected User A Summary:
```python
user_a_summary = expense_system.generate_individual_summary("A")
A owes B 50 (300 - 250)
D owes A 250
```

#### (Q3) List User's Expenses

Create a function that lists all the expenses a given user is involved in. This should include details of the expenses, such as the amount, shares, and the other participants.

Example:
```python
user_a_expenses = expense_system.list_user_expenses("A")
```
Expected User A's Expenses List:
```
1. A Pays 1000 with B, C, and D (EQUAL)
2. B Pays 1000 with A and C (EXACT => A = 300 C = 500)
3. C Pays 1000 with A, B, and D (PERCENTAGE => A = 25 B = 30 D = 10)
```

#### (Q4) Settle Funds

Develop a function that calculates and performs fund settlements between two users. Given two users, find the simplest way to settle the debts, if any exist.

Expected User A and B Settle Funds:
```python
user_a_summary = expense_system.settle_funds("A", "B")
>>> A has to Pay B 50
```


### Note:
> 1. We are trying to solve the above problem in a DS Algo (runtime) style and not building or solving it as an application
> 2. You can have any amount of space complexity.
> 3. add_expense can have any amount of time and space complexity.
> 4. generate_individual_summary, settle_funds and list_user_expenses should have least time complexity

### Additional Note: 
>  If you feel like the problem will take more than 40 minutes to solve, Start with just Equal Shares as the input share type (Skip Both exact and percentage share types till the end). Once all the functionalities are implemented you can change the share types to be dynamic ( Equal, Exact & Percentage )
